# Bayesian-Regression-Based-Marketing-Mix-Model-MMM-
Developed a predictive Marketing Mix Model using Bayesian regression to analyze Facebook, Google, TikTok, email impact on sales (~90% R², 10% MAPE). Optimized budget by recommending 20–30% reallocation to high-impact channels. Applied Hill-Adstock transformations to capture ad saturation, lag, boosting model accuracy.


# Summary:
Bayesian Regression-Based Marketing Mix Model (MMM) was developed to evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of marketing investments across four key digital channels: Facebook, Google, TikTok, and Email. The project aimed to quantify the impact of each channel on weekly sales for a direct-to-consumer fashion brand, using a data-driven, probabilistic approach to support strategic decision-making. Leveraging Bayesian regression with Hill-Adstock transformations, the model captured both ad saturation (diminishing returns from increased spend) and lag effects (delayed impact of campaigns), providing a nuanced and realistic representation of media influence over time.

The data was compiled from multiple sources and harmonized into a unified weekly time series. Through feature engineering and rigorous model tuning, the final model achieved a high level of accuracy with an R² of approximately 90% and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 10%. These results demonstrated the model’s ability to explain and predict sales based on marketing activities effectively.

Key findings from the model indicated that Facebook and Email were high-performing channels with strong positive ROI, while TikTok underperformed relative to its spend. As a result, the analysis recommended a 20–30% budget reallocation away from TikTok toward more effective platforms like Facebook and Email. This strategic adjustment was validated through budget optimization simulations, which showed improved marketing efficiency and potential revenue gains without increasing total expenditure.

Overall, this project showcased the power of Bayesian MMM in driving smarter, evidence-based marketing strategies. It highlighted the importance of modeling real-world advertising dynamics and provided actionable insights that enhanced ROI, supported budget planning, and informed long-term marketing strategy.
